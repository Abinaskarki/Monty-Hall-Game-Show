# Monty-Hall-Game-Show
A website where anyone can play a game from the TV game show, Let's Make A Deal, hosted by Monty Hall.
The scenario is such: you are given the opportunity to select one closed door of three, behind one of which there is a prize. 
The other two doors hide “goats” (or some other such “non-prize”), or nothing at all.
Once you have made your selection, Monty Hall will open one of the remaining doors, revealing that it does not contain the prize.
He then asks you if you would like to switch your selection to the other unopened door, or stay with your original choice.
You have the choice to switch or not. After you made your decision, all the doors will be opened. 
You will find if you win or not.

The TRICK is that you have to switch to have greater probability of winning the game.
